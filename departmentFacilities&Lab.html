                    <p>The Artificial Intelligence (AI) learning adventure explores intelligence and its connection to
                        engineering and technology. Using ideas about human intelligence and intelligence more broadly,
                        engineers can create “artificial intelligence”. A recent report by Pearson deciphers how
                        artificial intelligence will positively transform education in the coming years. Per the
                        report&apos;s authors, "The future offers the potential of even greater tools and supports.
                        Imagine
                        lifelong learning companions powered by AI that can accompany and support individual learners
                        throughout their studies - in and beyond school - or new forms of assessment that measure
                        learning while it is taking place, shaping the learning experience in real time.” AI has the
                        power to spur creativity, engagement and stronger learning outcomes among the students. With AI,
                        experiential or hands-on learning has an all new meaning.
